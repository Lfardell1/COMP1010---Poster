## Project Title:
Optimizing Peer-to-Peer Data Distribution and Fault Tolerance in Torrent Networks

## Authors:
- Leon
- Lucas
- Samuel
- Elliot
- Jesse 

## Overview:
This project investigates methods for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and fault tolerance of peer-to-peer (P2P) data distribution, with a particular focus on torrent networks. The research includes a detailed analysis of existing algorithms, identification of critical performance factors, and exploration of potential improvements through advanced data handling and redundancy techniques.

## Deliverables:
- **LaTeX Poster:** A professionally designed academic poster created using LaTeX, summarizing key findings and insights from the research.

## Instructions:
- Use LaTeX to design and compile our poster.
- Include clearly defined sections such as Abstract, Introduction, Technical Analysis, Results (with visualizations and graphs), Discussion (including ethical considerations), and Conclusion.
- The poster should be visually appealing and concise, designed to clearly communicate complex ideas to a target audience of Year 11-12 high-school students.

## Technical Details (Recommended to Include):
- Graphical representations of peer-to-peer data flows
- Performance comparison graphs
- Visual diagrams showing redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms

## Submission Format:
- PDF version of the LaTeX poster
- All associated LaTeX files (.tex, .bib)
- Any images, charts, or other files used to compile the poster

## Submission Deadline:
- Sunday of Week 7, 11:59 PM (via Canvas only)
